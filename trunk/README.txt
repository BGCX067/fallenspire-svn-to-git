Fallen Spire
------------

The world is twisted to madness, plagued by the living dreams of Zebertok - 
a demonic raven that slumbers at the center of the world. You are a sorcerer, 
specially chosen and trained to make the journey through the city of the dead 
and destroy the dark raven. But when your mentor dies prematurely, you must 
venture forth alone and unprepared to confront Zebertok and rid the world of 
his menace.

Running
-------

To run Fallen Spire you will need to have Python installed (2.5 or later) 
along with the PyGame, PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy modules. Then 
run the main script:

    python src/main.py


Compiling
---------

If you download the source from the SVN repository you will need to compile
the animations from the Blender3D model files. So you'll need to install
Blender (2.48 or later) and run "make all" to process the model files.
